I get up at 8 in morning & going to work, 5:30 in the evening come back home. I don't have much time before going to bed again and it will be another day.

**Something I have to do after work**
- Shower take 10 minutes
- Eat food take 30 minutes
- Have freelance work take another hour
- Have rush take another hour or 2 or 3
- **Take some time to learn new stuff**
